## Project Objective

This solution aims to optimize the E-commerce Customer Service (CS) Chatbot by utilizing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Large Language Model (LLM). 

## Problem Description

Traditional rule-based chatbots rely on predefined rules and patterns to generate responses. These bots follow a set of programmed instructions and keyword-based algorithms to interpret and respond to user inputs.

## Proposed GA-Driven Chatbot Solution

Our proposed chatbot solution utilizes a genetic algorithm to generate optimized prompts based on user input and feed the best prompt into our large language model. The main highlights of this solution are: 

- Genetic Algorithm is used to generate the best prompt which makes the client’s questions easier for LLM to understand. 

- The LLM-powered chatbot will respond to client’s inquiries in a human-like manner and generate contextual responses.
